### Learning Yacc (programming language)

I know very little about the YACC language. This article will go over all of my knowledge of the YACC language:

#### Comments in Yacc

Comments in Yacc are identical to comments in C, JavaScript, Java, Google Go, C++, etc..

```yacc
// This is a single line comment
/* This
is a multiline
comment */
/* Multi-line comments
* can also
* be written
* like this */
```

1. Yacc stands for **Y**et **A**nother **C**ompiler **C**ompiler

2. Yacc is maintained by GNU

3. Yacc is a UNIX scripting language

4. Yacc uses the `.yacc` and `.y` file extensions
